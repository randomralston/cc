                <h3>Draft Survey </h3>
                <p id="cat1" class="collapse"> It is important to ensure that the correct quantity of cargo has been loaded on to a vessel. Disputes can arise at the load or discharge port between the vessel owner and charterer, or the vessel and the shipper/receiver of the cargo.
                  <br><br>
                  For that purpose, it is important to have a marine surveyor verify the amount of cargo loaded or discharged, by Draft Survey. Our team has a vast experience in conducting draft surveys at various ports in Australia.</p>

                <h3>On/Off Hire Survey </h3>
                <p id="cat2" class="collapse"> It is very important to determine the general condition of the vessel when the vessel's owner hires the vessel out to a charterer. It is equally important for the charterer to know exactly what is being hired.
                  <br><br>
                  This calls for an On-Hire Condition and Bunker Survey. Our surveyors perform a detailed survey of the general condition of the vessel and cargo holds and quantify the bunkers on board, during the hiring or the de-hiring process.</p>

                <h3>Cargo Hold Cleanliness Inspection</h3>
                <p id="cat3" class="collapse"> Australia exports a variety of bulk cargoes, for which the cargo holds require to be in a rather clean condition. Potential contaminants such as rust or previous cargo residues are not tolerated. Once the vessel fails the cargo hold inspection, the expense of cleaning the cargo holds are astronomical, especially if a shore-based crew is engaged.
                  <br><br>
                  Cargo Care surveyors can inspect the vessel's cargo holds prior to inspection by shippers' surveyor and advise the Master/owner on what cleaning to carry out. In our experience, this has worked out very economical for our existing clients in the past.</p>

                <h3>Cargo Holds Water-tightness Test / Sealing</h3>
                <p id="cat4" class="collapse"> At times, it is required by charterers that vessel's cargo holds be tested for water-tightness prior to loading cargo. This could be for insurance purposes. It may further be required that hatch covers and hatch entrances be sealed with numbered security seals, after loading is complete.
                  <br><br>
                  Cargo Care can assist with both the above, by performing a hose test or chalk test on the hatch covers and entrances. Hatch entrances and hatch covers are also sealed by our surveyors after completion of loading.</p>

                  To prevent that from happening, our surveyors board the vessel prior to the PSC surveyor and conduct a preparatory inspection. Any deficiencies found, are promptly rectified by ship's crew.</p>
